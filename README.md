## 🖋️ Introduction
**TranscriptionNet** is an attention-based deep learning algorithm that integrates various large-scale gene function network information to predict changes in induced gene expression (GECs) by perturbing each gene in the genome.<br>

An overview of TranscriptionNet can be seen below.

**TranscriptionNet** is composed of two networks, **FunDNN** (functional network-based deep neural network) and **GenSAN** (genetic perturbation-based self-attention network), which load the genome-wide functional connection knowledge among genes and complementary information between different types of genetic interference manners on same genes, respectively.<br>
* **FunDNN** uses adjacency matrices for multiplex gene interaction networks as input. Each network passes through a three-layer Graph Attention Network (GAT) to generate network-specific gene features, which are then combined into the integrated features. The integrated features are propagated through multiple dense layers to fit pre-GECs induced by each types of genetic perturbation (RNAi, OE, and CRISPR).<br>
* **GenSAN** takes GECs for all three types of genetic perturbations as input. takes GECs for all three types of genetic perturbations as input. The pre-GECs of RNAi and the real GECs of CRISPR and OE are processed together through multi-layer transformer encoding blocks (with axial self-attention in the dual-tower architecture) to capture complementary gene expression information between them. Moreover, the self-attention block is reinforced by feeding the processed GECs recursively into the same modules (named “recycling”). Finally, the predicted GECs for RNAi can be extracted from the output GECs matrix.
